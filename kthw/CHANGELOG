----
- Moving distribute and _execute_on_nodes to lib
- _execute_on_nodes receives a parameter telling it whether or not to continue
  exeuction after the operation fails on any node
- for positive functions, passing stop to execute_on_nodes, so if the operation fails
  on any node, we stop exeuction
  for negative functions, we pass continue to execute_on_nodes, so we do a best effort to
  do the negative function, and the user will need to handle the failed node
