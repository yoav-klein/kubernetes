1.1
----
- Moving distribute and _execute_on_nodes to lib
- _execute_on_nodes receives a parameter telling it whether or not to continue
  exeuction after the operation fails on any node
- for positive functions, passing stop to execute_on_nodes, so if the operation fails
  on any node, we stop exeuction
  for negative functions, we pass continue to execute_on_nodes, so we do a best effort to
  do the negative function, and the user will need to handle the failed node

New logging style

In the logging library, we introduced a new flag of "human" - so that
pretty messages will be printed only if this flag is set.

So in the manager scripts, we set this flag depending if the user
runs the manager script independently we will print those messages,
but if we run it using the kthwctl utility, it won't

In addition, we redirect all the output of the agent scripts to a log file,
so that if there's a failure, it will be recorded there so the user can examine it
