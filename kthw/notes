To do:
-----
* Consider: How to make sure that when running control-plane, etcd is already up?
* consider adding a test function to agents
* loglevel in manager scripts should be coordinated
* certificates: error checking and logging
* add "dirty" field to status: split the creating directory step from installing service step 
  in all stages
* Adding tests to workers - kubectl get nodes - count
* Adding tests to networking
* smoke tests
* kthwctl 
* status when nodes are empty (agent script is not there)

Nice to have:
-----------
* before scp to nodes, check if already exist
* jsonschema

limitations:
-------------
* in control plane, there's a problem is checking if service is intalled
or service is up, since we're talking about 3 services. So there are some edge
cases which are not taken care of

* leaving nodes with jq installed
* after running pods, you can't remove /var/lib/kubelet directory: resource busy

Edge cases:
----------
- After running something in the cluster, trying to kubelet reset
  fails


to learn
--------

bash
* set -e



kubernetes
* encryption config
* cluster networking
* authorization modes

intereseting
---------
* changing the CN and O in the apiserver-kubelet-client
  didn't seem to change anything. is this certificate useful?
