To do:
-----
* Consider: How to make sure that when running control-plane, etcd is already up?
* loglevel in manager scripts should be coordinated
* add "dirty" field to status: split the creating directory step from installing service step 
  in all stages
* smoke tests
* kthwctl 
* status when nodes are empty (agent script is not there)

consider
-------
* When some node fails, in the manager scripts, we stop execution
  maybe we need to make the _execute_on_nodes function configurable
  to allow continuing processing on error
* test_networking is pretty lame, see if you can improve it

Nice to have:
-----------
* before scp to nodes, check if already exist
* jsonschema
* implementing CNI plugin

limitations:
-------------
* leaving nodes with jq installed

Edge cases:
----------
- After running something in the cluster, trying to kubelet reset
  fails


to learn
--------

bash
* set -e



kubernetes
* encryption config
* cluster networking
* authorization modes

intereseting
---------
* changing the CN and O in the apiserver-kubelet-client
  didn't seem to change anything. is this certificate useful?


Safe functions
