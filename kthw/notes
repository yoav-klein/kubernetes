To do:
-----
* Worker nodes
* Consider creating a systemd library with common functions like install, uninstall,
    status, etc. for easier management
* Logging library
* Consider a copying engine - you write a file that describes what to copy where,
    and the engine makes sure to perform it - instead of writing it in the 'distribute' function
* Consider ansible?
* etcd: test that systemd service is running
* control-plane: add test


Bugs:
-----
* when running clean_nodes in control-plane, it deletes
kubectl in all the controller machines, but we need it 
to generate the kubeconfigs


Deployment process:
--------
When we come to deploy on the nodes, we basically do the following steps:
- install prerequisites (check if fulfilled, if not install)
- scp files (service files, certificates, kubeconfigs, setup script, etc.)
- copy files to correct location (setup script?)
- install systemd service
- run systemd service

We want to allow the user at any moment:
- stop the services
- uninstall the services
- prune (delete everything we've copied)
- check status
