To do:
-----
* Worker nodes
* Consider ansible?
* Consider: How to make sure that when running control-plane, etcd is already up?
* Change distribute in etcd to be like conrol plane
* etcd manager and agent needs a refactor
* consider adding a test function to agents
* loglevel in manager scripts should be coordinated


Nice to have:
-----------
* before scp to nodes, check if already exist


limitations:
-------------
* in control plane, there's a problem is checking if service is intalled
or service is up, since we're talking about 3 services. So there are some edge
cases which are not taken care of

* leaving nodes with jq installed
