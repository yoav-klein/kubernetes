To do:
-----
* Consider: How to make sure that when running control-plane, etcd is already up?
* loglevel in manager scripts should be coordinated
* smoke tests
* kthwctl 

smoke tests
------------
- create a deployment
- create a service


kthwctl
---------
* bootstrap
* reset
* delete node
* status

consider
-------
* When some node fails, in the manager scripts, we stop execution
  maybe we need to make the _execute_on_nodes function configurable
  to allow continuing processing on error
* test_networking is pretty lame, see if you can improve it


Investigate
-------------
* After insatlling the network plugin once, which brings the nodes
to a Ready state, and after deleteing the nodes and creating them again,
  they become Ready, although I removed the weavenet pods from the cluster.

Nice to have:
-----------
* before scp to nodes, check if already exist
* jsonschema
* implementing CNI plugin

limitations:
-------------
* leaving nodes with jq installed

Edge cases:
----------
- After running something in the cluster, trying to kubelet reset
  fails


to learn
--------

bash
* set -e



kubernetes
* encryption config
* cluster networking
* authorization modes

intereseting
---------
* changing the CN and O in the apiserver-kubelet-client
  didn't seem to change anything. is this certificate useful?


Documentation
---------
- introduction - some background about the project
- architecture/structure - how it's built - folder for each part etc. manager and agent script, etc.
- usage
- technical details - idempotency,
