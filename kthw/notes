To do:
-----
* Worker nodes
* Consider ansible?
* Consider: How to make sure that when running control-plane, etcd is already up?


Nice to have:
-----------
* before scp to nodes, check if already exist


limitations:
-------------
* in control plane, there's a problem is checking if service is intalled
or service is up, since we're talking about 3 services. So there are some edge
cases which are not taken care of
