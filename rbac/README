This is a demonstration of Role Based Access Control
There is a Role and a RoleBinding specs here.
The Role defines permissions to get, watch and list pods in the
"my-app" namespace.

The RoleBinding binds the user named "yoav" to that role.

Prerequisites:
- a namespace named "my-app"
- a user named "yoav", which means:
  - a certificate signed with the cluster's CA, with "yoav" as the CN
  - a .kube/config file pointing to the cluster's URL, and defining a user 
    named "yoav" (or not necessarily) pointing to the yoav.key and yoav.crt files
